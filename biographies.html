  <h1>Meet The Buzzkills</h1>
  <div class="content-box" style="margin-bottom: 30px; display: flex; flex-direction: row; gap: 20px; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center; align-items: flex-start;">
    <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 280px; max-width: 400px;">
      <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;">
        The Dandy Buzzkills are a hard band to define, and I think they prefer it that way. Drawing as much influence from Boris as they do XTC, the tight, densely packed sound of the group has drawn well-deserved attention from crowds captivated by meticulously crafted recordings and a live show that is as shambolic as it is powerful.<br><br>
        Since the release of <em>I Wanna...</em> in 2021, the band has gained and lost several members, redefined its sound, and thrown enough bananas into the crowd to keep the potassium levels in Adelaide, South Australia at an all-time high. With the release of their debut EP <em>I Can Feed The Fish Earthworms</em>, Maxwell, Hudson, Jack and Olly captured with great care their unique sound, the songs rich with texture and hidden detail, the EP only truly reveals itself after several listens.<br><br>
        The band now finds itself embarking on an ambitious release schedule of new material into 2025, not focussing on social media engagement, but on enhancing their craft and offering something you can’t find in most corners of the Australian music scene — that being an attention to detail and genuine care for their music, all while not taking themselves seriously and keeping people (the writer of this bio included) scratching their heads, wondering what comes next for The Dandy Buzzkills.<br><br>
